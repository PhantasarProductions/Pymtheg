# Simple pixel deck by 1 Up Nuke

This is a very simplistic pixel art deck by 1 Up Nuke.
You can post suggesions and issues about this deck in the issue tracker as 1 up will be notified about it.


You may want to put multiple cards on one big image to see how to print it best, we'll leave that up to you.

The MultiElement.png card can serve as a joker if you like, although Pymtheg does not use Jokers ;)
But the deck does have some use for other games you can make up yourself. Be creative ;)
