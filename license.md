The proper license is yet still being discussed.

For sure is that the Phantasar universe is my property and will remain my property no matter what happens.

For the Pymtheg game and its playable decks a less strict license may be in order, but I am still investigating what is best. Until that time, all you may do is download the stuff for your own personal purposes.
