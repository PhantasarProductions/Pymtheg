# Introduction
Phantasar is a world with data beyond your imagination. "The Secrets of Dyrt", "The Fairy Tale" and the novel "Weniaria" are only the tip of the iceberg of how deep the lore of Phantasar goes.

Phantasar has many cultures, with their own history, their own languages, and their own religions.

Yes, this also means the people of Phantasar have their own games. Some games will not be transferrable to Earth. I mean the sport Circleball is played by Befindos in the air. Since we can't fly, that's kinda bothersome, eh?

Pymtheg however is a card game, so hey, we can play it too. ;)

Pymtheg is a very popular game among the Befindos. Especially the ones who live in the "high society" play the game very often. The game has much in common with game like bridge, spades, hearts, etc. If you are familiar with any of these games or games in the same "family" then the rules of Pymtheg will be easy to learn. However Pymtheg requires its own deck of cards.
