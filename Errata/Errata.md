- Please note, the requirement that a Gâm+1 can only be bid when a Gâm has been bid only applies to Gâm variants. Ry can always be bid, unless a higher bid has already be done before. Same goes for Lon (although a higher bid than Lon is not possible).
- The penalty given for failing a bid when overbidding a Ry variant only applies when
  - The opposing team does this, so when your partner does it the penalty is NOT given.
  - The bid overbidding the Ry is a variant of Gâm. So when the bid is a Ry variant or Lon, this penalty does not apply.
  - If a Gâm variant was used to overbid a Ry, and another bid was done after that, the penalty no longer applies UNLESS another Ry variant has been bid.
- It does not matter if the Gâm variant used to overbid a Ry was a normal Ry or a Ry 2 or Ry 3. The penalty applies to all three variants. Of course when overbidding a Ry the Ry points apply as penalty when overbidding Ry 2 the Ry 2 points and when overbidding a Ry 3 the Ry 3 points. I guess this was obvious.
