# Errata

This folder contains the errata.md document.

It often happens when a game is released that certain rules do not work.
If that happens they will be corrected in the official rules, and in the errata.md the modifications will be noted.

The prime function of errata documents is however that some rules are often incorrectly interpreted. This can sometimes lead to situations like "if you do that you'll always win so the rules are overpowered", although if you played with the rules as they were intended things do not seem that powerful. It can sometimes also lead to game stagnation, or players knowing things they were not supposed to know. It is always very important that rules can only be interpreted in one way only. However when you create a game like this, you as the creator may think the rules are clear, but you'll always find out when your game meets the players they are not. 
If such things get known to the game creator an errata is often in order in which rules are clarified and taken to its proper meaning. 
After all, only if all players understand the rules for the full 100%, you can experience the game the way the original creator intended it.
