# Pymtheg
A card game


Pymtheg is a card game based on Bridge and Rikken, with a bit of a fantasy theme in mind.
It requires a special deck of cards due to a regular deck not having enough cards to play Pymtheg (although alternate rules can be set up to make this possible).

This repository will when the game is released contain PNG files containing the basic cards set, which should be printed on thick paper, and some PDF files containing the playing rules, most likely in both the English and Dutch languages (although I am considering to release those in MD format as well). Pull requests with translations to other languages are very likely to be accepted.

Over time, when the rules are changed some errata files may be published here (very likely in English only and in MarkDown so they can be easily read from this repository). Rule translators may do very well to keep a good eye on these, as they can require you to adapt your translations.
