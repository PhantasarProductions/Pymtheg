# Game Manual

In this folder all game manuals will be located.
The manual will contain the rules of Pymtheg itself, the subgame burn and some background information about the game, and its relation to the Phantasar saga.

The only two languages I am fluent in are English and Dutch. The English and Dutch manuals will therefore be done by me.
You are allowed to translate the manual to any language I don't know as long as your translation comes as close to the original manuals as your language allows, and as much the same layout (with the pictures I used) as possible.

Also note when reporting issues about the game manuals I'll only accept issues about the English and Dutch versions of the manuals, unless the translator has been given "official" status by me, and thus has admin rights over this repo.


The best way to send in a translation is by means of pull requests. 
However

- I do only accept pull requests for languages either not present yet, and if present if the pull request is done by the original creator of the translation or if the original creator let me know (best way is to comment the pull request) he approves of the modification.
- Although I may not speak your language, I can still review your translation. In several languages I also got my connections. :-P
